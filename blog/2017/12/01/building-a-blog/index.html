<p>This post will guide through how to use this blog &quot;engine&quot; and why I&#39;ve built it. </p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>I just want Markdown files being converted to blog posts, so the usage should be very simple for this use case.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-post">Creating a post</h3>
<p>This should change. For now, I&#39;ll just create a new directory under <code>/posts/drafts</code>, call it whatever I want and put an
<code>.md</code> file with the same name under it. You can add meta data like title by adding a <code>.json</code> file into that directory.</p>
<h3 id="publishing-a-post">Publishing a post</h3>
<p>The command <code>npm run publish &lt;draft-name&gt;</code> uses the <code>.json</code> and <code>.md</code> files inside the draft directory and creates a 
post from it. It will create a <code>.json</code> if none exists and add a <code>createdAt</code> field to it with the current date.</p>
<p>It will also move the whole directory of the post from <code>/posts/drafts/&lt;draft-name&gt;</code> into 
<code>/posts/published/&lt;draft-name&gt;</code>.</p>
<h3 id="editing-a-published-post">Editing a published post</h3>
<p>If I need to change a published post, I can edit it directly and another run of <code>npm run publish &lt;draft-name&gt;</code> takes 
care of updating the <code>lastEditedOn</code> field. It will try to find the draft in <code>/posts/published/&lt;draft-name&gt;</code> first and if
it doesn&#39;t find it there, it will resort to a regular publish.</p>
<h3 id="rebuilding-the-blog">Rebuilding the blog</h3>
<p><code>npm run build</code> recreates all published posts with the template in <code>template/article.html</code>. This is useful to change the
design whenever I want to.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>There are a lot of frameworks available to create your own blog. I thought it makes sense to give some reasons why I&#39;ve
built yet another one.</p>
<ol>
<li>Building stuff is fun! Why evaluate and decide between established frameworks that are probably not as flexible as I
wish them to be when building one myself seems possible?</li>
<li>GitHub is free for doing things open source and it&#39;s free to host something as simple as this. I do not expect this 
to get very popular, so I am able to learn and try out a few things while building it.</li>
<li>Automating workflows is something I want to get better with and this enables me to get more into an automation 
workflow.</li>
<li>I want to be able to link to my thoughts when I create something new. Doing so by creating blog postsseems like a 
good idea. </li>
<li>Maybe this gets updated a bit more so I can make it reusable at some point.</li>
</ol>
