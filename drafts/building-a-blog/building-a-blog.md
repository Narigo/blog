# Building a blog

There are so many frameworks and I just want to build stuff. It's a lot more fun than trying out all these frameworks.
And to create my own scripted blog stuff, I should add some more test articles. Well, this is obviously one because I 
have not really something to say other than what I'm building here right now.
