<p>When I started to use a Mac, I wasn&#39;t aware of some really nice features that I wasn&#39;t used to in the Windows or Linux
world. Especially capturing (parts) of the screen to show a bug or a workflow wasn&#39;t something that could be done with
preinstalled applications.</p>
<p>I wish I knew some of these things earlier, so I&#39;m documenting and sharing them here.</p>
<h2 id="taking-screenshots">Taking screenshots</h2>
<p>Taking a screenshot is quite simple by using keyboard shortcuts. <code>Command + Shift + 3</code> will capture the whole screen
and save the captured image on your desktop. <code>Command + Shift + 4</code> changes your cursor and lets you drag a rectangle on
the part of the screen you want to capture. Use <code>Control + Command + Shift + &lt;3 or 4&gt;</code> to save the result of your
screen grab into the clipboard.</p>
<p>If the keyboard shortcuts won&#39;t work for you, you can also use the &quot;Preview&quot; application and use the &quot;Take Screenshot
...&quot; item in the &quot;File&quot; menu.</p>
<h2 id="record-the-screen">Record the screen</h2>
<p>The QuickTimePlayer has powerful features for recording the screen. Open the app, select &quot;New Screen Recording&quot; (or
press <code>Control + Command + N</code>). You can drag a rectangle to record only a part of your screen or press the big button
in the middle of your screen to record the complete screen.</p>
<h2 id="annotate-pictures-or-screenshots-">Annotate pictures (or screenshots)</h2>
<p>The Preview application lets you annotate images and screenshots. To find this possibility, select the &quot;Show Markup
Toolbar&quot; option. With these, you can draw bordered rectangles to highlight something, write text on the image or add
lines and arrows. I think it&#39;s a bit strange that it creates the thing you select as a new layer without you &quot;dragging&quot;
it on the screen, but you can move your selected option on a new layer without problems.</p>
<h2 id="taking-a-screen-recording-with-a-video-capture-of-your-webcam">Taking a screen recording with a video capture of your webcam</h2>
<p>When doing a movie recording with QuickTimePlayer and the starting the Screen Recording, the movie may get hidden below
other windows. To keep the camera window on top of every other window, open the &quot;View&quot; menu and select the &quot;Float on
Top&quot; option. If you turn on the internal microphone recording on the Screen Recording, you can record a video of you
and the screen at the same time.</p>
<h2 id="bonus-mov-to-animated-gif">Bonus: MOV to animated GIF</h2>
<p>Embedding videos in commentaries or similar can be quite a hassle. It&#39;s usually much easier to embed animated GIFs
instead. <a href="https://www.onlineconverter.com/mov-to-gif">Online MOV to GIF services</a> worked well for me, but if you are
working on large files with a slow connection, you might want to check out this
<a href="https://github.com/mortenjust/droptogif">open source video to GIF converter</a>.</p>
<p>When using the online converter, the GIF animation came out pretty &quot;slow&quot; for me. Using <code>ffmpeg</code> helped me to make it
faster by executing this command:</p>
<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input.gif -filter:v &quot;setpts=0.125*PTS&quot; -r 60 output.gif
</code></pre><p>This removes some frames instead of making the &quot;show next image&quot; faster but the result worked for me. You can try 
different PTS (&quot;presentation time stamp&quot;) settings and different frame rates (<code>-r 60</code> means 60 frames per second as
output).</p>
<p>You can also use <code>ffmpeg</code> directly to convert <code>.mov</code> to <code>.gif</code> instead of using an online converter. Use the command:</p>
<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input.mov output.gif
</code></pre><p>It can take the options from above directly, so if the online converter did not work well for you, you can directly
convert from <code>-i your.mov</code> via <code>&lt;options&gt;</code> to <code>output.gif</code>.</p>
