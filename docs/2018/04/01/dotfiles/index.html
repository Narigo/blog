<p>Setting up servers, computers and other things made myself wonder about how I could automate or optimize my own 
workflows. There are a lot of great examples what aliases people set up for themselves. I&#39;ve wondered if I could do the
same for myself and keep it modular for multiple operating systems as well. The project that I have been tinkering with
is simply called <a href="https://github.com/Narigo/dotfiles">dotfiles</a> and is largely based on the input of great resources I 
have found via <a href="https://dotfiles.github.io">dotfiles.github.io</a>.</p>
<p>In my case, I&#39;ve been looking to get a backup for my regular dotfiles, which were not really complex when I started. 
While working on it, I&#39;ve been digging into a lot of settings that help me automate and optimize commands and aliases. 
As I was concerned about overwriting all my configuration files, I&#39;ve added a <code>backup</code> folder. Existing configuration
files get a backup there before overwriting them now. I don&#39;t want to make that mistake twice...</p>
<p>There is also a dry-run option. Doing <code>. install.sh -d</code>  will generate all files in the <code>.dry-run/</code> directory, so you 
can see what the resulting files will look like.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-write-a-module">How to write a module</h2>
<p>For now, my modules have simple &quot;commands&quot; which can be used. They can either copy all files into a directory (usually 
<code>~/</code>) or concatenate all files into a single file residing somewhere. Through the former I can directly set 
configuration files like <code>.gitconfig</code> and through the latter I can split aliases, setting of paths and adding scripted 
logic into separate files. Maybe this will help me to reuse parts of it cross-platform later.</p>
<p>Right now, I&#39;ve set up <code>.settings-macos</code> files in the two first modules, namely <code>git</code> and <code>shell</code>. In the 
<code>.settings-macos</code> I can either put a line like <code>platform_file=&lt;file_to_concatenate_into&gt;</code> or a line 
<code>copy_files_to=&lt;directory_to_copy_into&gt;</code>. If the script finds a <code>platform_file</code>, it tries to concatenate all files in a
single file. If it finds a <code>copy_files_to</code>, it will simply copy all files into that directory.</p>
<p>For example, to recreate git settings, you need to put a <code>.gitconfig</code> file into your <code>$HOME</code> directory. Hence the 
<code>.settings-macos</code> file contains <code>copy_files_to=$HOME</code>. The script will evaluate the <code>.settings-*</code> files, so keep that in
mind when doing anything inside of them.</p>
<p>The shell module on the other hand, needs to concatenate multiple files into the <code>.bash_profile</code>. Usually, the 
<code>.settings-macos</code> should contain <code>platform_file=$HOME/.bash_profile</code>.</p>
<h2 id="extra-settings">Extra settings</h2>
<p>There are two special extra settings. The first file is to an arbitrary shell script running any commands we like on a 
platform. This is useful to set various OS-dependant options and flags that make the system behave more like I want it 
to. For example in MacOS it will set options for Finder that I think are better than the defaults. The second &quot;extra&quot;
settings file is to set up user specific stuff. For me, it sets git user options etc.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Creating a repository and thinking more about automating my own workflow really help to get repetitive things done much 
faster. Working on it also leads to thinking more into a direction of DevOps: Scripting all of my configuration to
prevent myself from making mistakes setting up a new machine.</p>
